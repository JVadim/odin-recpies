    <li>1 tablespoon finely minced fresh garlic</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>
    <li> 2 teaspoons minced fresh oregano</li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme or rosemary</li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon finely ground pink salt, or to taste</li>
    <li> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li> 4 (6 ounce) cod filets</li>
    <li> 2 lemons, each cut into 8 thin slices</li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li> 4 sprigs fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>

   <p></p>
   <h2>Steps:</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place softened butter, minced garlic, parsley, oregano, and thyme or rosemary on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, cut herbs and garlic into each other and the butter, cutting and mixing as you go. Add pink salt, black pepper, and paprika, and mix until well blended.</li>
    <li>Pat cod filets dry. In a 12x18-inch casserole or baking pan, place each filet on top of 2 lemon slices. Evenly divide herb butter mixture among the filets; use a fork or offset spatula to spread herb butter over filets. Top each filet with 2 remaining lemon slices.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cod flakes easily with a fork, 13 to 15 minutes. See note.</li>
    <li>To serve, drizzle each filet with extra virgin olive oil, and garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
   </ol>
